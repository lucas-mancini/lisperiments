lisperiments
============

Lisperiments is a place to store some experiments I've developed for academic purposes.

Currently there are four assignments given in class and developed in Common Lisp, you can checkout or browse the code:

 * A TLC-Lisp interpreter (TLC stands for The Lisp Company dialect of the language)
 * A kind of gps program that looks for the shortest path on a given graph
 * A pseudo-C interpreter (the parser is not implemented, so the input is a C program but in the form of S-expressions)
 * A possible recursive solution for the famous N Queens puzzle

 
The programs were tested using Gnu Clisp (which is an ANSI Common Lisp implementation) under Ubuntu Linux 11.04. Sorry for the specs and code comments in spanish, I'll try to modify them some day.
